30岁前，请逼自己成为这样的人



That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem,and it had real consequences,not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere.



claiming your 20s in one of the simplest,yet most transformative,things you can do for work,for love,for your happiness,maybe even for the world.



We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your 20s as it rewires itself for adulthood,which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself,now is the time to change it.

to achieve great things,you need a plan and not quite enough time.



You can't pick your family,but you can pick your friends.





forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital



adds value to who you are.



Do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next.



no one knows the future of work,but I do know this:

Identity capital begets identity capital.



I'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here,but I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count,which ,by the way,is not exploration.

That's procrastination.



That new piece of capital,that new person to date almost comes from outside the inner circle. New things come from what are called our weak ties,our friends of friends of friends.



who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time  with whoever happens to be choosing you.



Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do.
